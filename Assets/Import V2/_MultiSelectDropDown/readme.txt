Hey there! 

Thanks for buying this asset, it means the world to me!
In the package you will find two versions of the same script, one using Unity's UI system and the other one TMP
The dropdown list is basically composed of two prefabs, the list itself and it's template.
I've also added my ObjectPooling system to the list, feel free to reuse it and credit it in any project.
The items are automatically registered to their events but you can create and add as my as you want.


If you have any questions fell free to contact me at: youtouchofficial@gmail.com

Have a great day!
Alex
